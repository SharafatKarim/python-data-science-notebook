# Introduction

+++ {"part": "abstract"}
My notebook about python & data science!

## Introduction

I think you can go through google or an LLM to learn what actually python or data science is, so I won't be explaining that here. And yah, LLMs can also help you understand the code snippets in this notebook, so you can use them to learn more about python and data science.

## Installation

I am using Arch Linux, where the following commands will install the required packages:

```shell
sudo pacman -S python python-pip jupyter jupyter-book
```

> For other OS, look for python, pip, jupyter, and jupyter-book in your package manager or follow the instructions on their respective websites.

## Target Audience

Well this is a simple note about python, for intermediate level programmers, who want to learn more about python and how to use it in their daily work. So I'll not be explaining the basics of python, but rather how to use it in a more advanced way.
