## Introduction

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing. Jupyter is an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Installation

Depending on the operating system, python can be installed right from your package manager, such as winget (Windows), brew (macOS), or apt (Ubuntu). I am using Arch Linux, where the following commands will install the required packages with `pacman` as my package manager,

```shell
sudo pacman -S python python-pip jupyter jupyter-book
```

> For other OS, look for python, pip, jupyter, and jupyter-book in your package manager or follow the instructions on their respective websites.

## Target Audience

In my note I will not cover the basics in details. I will focus on codes for referencial purpose. Anyone with a good domain knowledge of any other programming language can easily understand the code snippets in this notebook, ing sha Allah!
