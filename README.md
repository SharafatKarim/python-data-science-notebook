# Python & Data Science Notebook

[![Made with MyST](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange)](https://myst.tools)

Welcome to my Python notebook! Here, I document my experiments, learning, and insights as I explore Python and Data Science. This repository serves as a living record of my journey, including code snippets, notes, and useful resources.

## About This Project

This notebook is built using [Jupyter Book](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) and leverages the power of [MyST Markdown](https://myst.tools) for enhanced documentation and interactivity. MyST enables rich formatting, executable code blocks, and seamless integration with Jupyter notebooks.
