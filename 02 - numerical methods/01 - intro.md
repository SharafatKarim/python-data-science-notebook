## Introduction

Numerical methods are techniques used to solve mathematical problems numerically, often when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible.

## Installation

Besides python, we may need to install,

- `numpy`: for numerical operations
- `scipy`: for scientific computing
- `matplotlib`: for plotting and visualization
